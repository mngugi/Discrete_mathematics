Complex Numbers
Definition

A complex number is any number that can be written in the form:

z = a + bi

where:

a is the real part of z

b is the imaginary part of z

i is the imaginary unit, defined by i² = −1

We write this as:

Re(z) = a
Im(z) = b

Set of Complex Numbers

The set of all complex numbers is denoted by:

ℂ = { a + bi | a, b ∈ ℝ }

Equality of Complex Numbers

Two complex numbers are equal if and only if both their real and imaginary parts are equal.

If z₁ = a + bi and z₂ = c + di, then:

z₁ = z₂ ⟺ a = c and b = d

Visual Intuition (Complex Plane)

We can represent each complex number z = a + bi as a point (a, b) on the complex plane, also known as the Argand diagram.
